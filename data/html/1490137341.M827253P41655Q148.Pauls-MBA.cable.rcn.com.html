out how google develop web frameworks. I have to admit that my request is f=
rom a perspective on how to provide business solutions for enterprises and =
how to utilize tools and frameworks for doing this. In addition to developi=
ng frameworks as you mentioned there arise some other requirements and need=
s. I'd appreciate if you would also give these kind of requirements some va=
luation. At the end, we all would benefit more from each other and angular =
2 could be a more powerful framework.</p>
