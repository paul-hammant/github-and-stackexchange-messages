 I can agree with some of you arguments. But on the other side I see also p=
laces on your side where you should re-think your application concepts simp=

<p>We are probably on the end of our discussion because the standpoint of A=
ngular core team is important from this point of view. I just wanted to exp=
ress some background arguments why AOT is a prefered way now.</p>
