<p>This is a feature I am proposing for a future Angular.</p>
<p><strong>Current behavior</strong></p>
<p>Both FormGroup and FormControl provide <code>.valueChanges</code>, and observable stream of changes to the control or group of controls' value. This is very helpful, but it seems to omit the first value (before the first &quot;change&quot;) for no particularly good reason other than consistency with the name.</p>
<p>This is easily worked around by with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>const x$ = this.aControl.valueChanges.startWith(this.aControl.value);
</code></pre>
<p>... which is effective, but verbose and repetitive.</p>
<p><strong>Expected behavior</strong></p>
<p>Programmatically, very often when handling a control or group as an observable stream, one wants access to the entire stream from the beginning.</p>
<p>Therefore, I request that <code>.valueChanges</code> be supplemented with <code>.values</code>, which would be an Observable that emits both the initial value and changes.</p>
<p><strong>Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions</strong></p>
<p>A search of Github yields numerous cases and published Angular code where something similar to the above pattern appears.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/search?q=valueChanges.startWith&amp;ref=simplesearch&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">https://github.com/search?q=valueChanges.startWith&amp;ref=simplesearch&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93</a></p>
<p>All of these, as well as similar code behind countless corporate firewalls, could be tightened up by this API improvement.</p>
