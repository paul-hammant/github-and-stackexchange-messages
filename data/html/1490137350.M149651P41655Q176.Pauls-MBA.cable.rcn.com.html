 And this is a problem in reality if you apply that principe in a large sco=
pe. Because you can not make proper tests as a lot of code is translated in=
 runtime, so you find a lot of hidden errors only at runtime. And this unac=
ceptable. You can play with that concept only in a small scale and still yo=
u will risc a lot of unpredictability.</p>
