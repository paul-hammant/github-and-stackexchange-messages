<pre><code>Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebr=
ew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!

Warning: Homebrew's sbin was not found in your PATH but you have installed
formulae that put executables in /usr/local/sbin.
Consider setting the PATH for example like so
  echo 'export PATH=3D&quot;/usr/local/sbin:$PATH&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_p=
rofile

Warning: Some keg-only formula are linked into the Cellar.
Linking a keg-only formula, such as gettext, into the cellar with
`brew link &lt;formula&gt;` will cause other formulae to detect them during
the `./configure` step. This may cause problems when compiling those
other formulae.

Binaries provided by keg-only formulae may override system binaries
with other strange results.

You may wish to `brew unlink` these brews:
  node@6
  qt@5.5
  homebrew/versions/v8-315
