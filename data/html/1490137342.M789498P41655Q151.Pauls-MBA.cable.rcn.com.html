 Yes I know, my sample wasn't about swapping out templates at all. You said=

<p>This is what I did. I provided a solution to your problem, not in the wa=
y you wanted to solve it, but it's a solution none the less. However, my po=
int remains; I don't see what you're gaining by having templates swapped in=
 and out if it were somehow possible, in both cases you'd still have to wri=
te the template code, so what exactly do you gain for the largely extensive=
 amount of work it would take to get even close to implementing something l=
ike this in the framework?</p>
