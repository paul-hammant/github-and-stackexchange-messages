<p>Actually Http calls runs as expected, but this code:</p>
<pre><code>const applicationRef: ApplicationRef =3D moduleRef.injector.get(=
ApplicationRef);
    return toPromise
        .call(first.call(filter.call(applicationRef.isStable, (isStable: bo=
olean) =3D&gt; isStable)))
        .then(() =3D&gt; {
          const output =3D platform.injector.get(PlatformState).renderToStr=
ing();
          platform.destroy();
          return output;
});
</code></pre>
<p>which renders html runs before async http operation finish. It simply do=
es not wait for this operation to finish. Interesting is that this is not p=
roblem with original HTTP, but with custom HTTP it happens in wrong order. =
That is reason why you dont see results of http requests rendered from serv=
er side.</p>
