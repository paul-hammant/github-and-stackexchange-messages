</a> Hmm...but your plunker does not even change the query params in the ur=
l? Still does not seem to work for me in this example: <a href=3D"http://pl=

If you click on the link, it changes the query param and should therefore u=
pdate with a new random number, which it does not.<br>
You can also see that in the console. The &quot;resolve&quot; log will be e=
xecuted, but not the &quot;in subscribe&quot; log.</p>
