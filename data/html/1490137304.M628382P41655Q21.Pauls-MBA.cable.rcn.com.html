<p><strong>Current behavior</strong></p>
<p>The new syntax is a great improvement!</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div *ngIf=&quot;userStream|async as user&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>... And was discussed at length in <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15020" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15020" data-id="212899364" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-permission-text="Issue title is private">#15020</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Expected behavior</strong></p>
<p>The ability to capture the async pipe output and make it available as a template variable, is <strong>much appreciated and very useful</strong>. Unfortunately, this capability is currently bound closely to <code>*ngIf</code>; it is only available is a feature of <code>*ngIf</code>. (I am aware that there is something similar for <code>*ngFor</code>, unrelated to this feature request).</p>
<p>Here's what I request: that this capability be yanked apart from the conditional (<code>*ngIf</code>), and made available elsewhere.</p>
<p>I don't know what syntax would make the most sense. Perhaps:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div *ngLet=&quot;userStream|async as user&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or alternatively; it would be excellent to have a syntax to directly use any observable anywhere in a template, with the reactivity handled by Angular, and without worrying about potentially multiple async pipe instances needlessly subscribing many times. For example, imagine the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Hello, {{ userStream^.name }}&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?</strong></p>
<p>I have a use case in front of me, the details which don't matter, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a handful of observable streams with data to use in the template.</li>
<li>Some of them occasionally have falsely values; but I still want to use them even if that is the case.</li>
<li>Currently I'm doing some hackery to deal with the falsely problem, and nesting a big chunk of my template in a handful of nested <code>*ngIf</code>s which exists solely for the purpose of giving access to this ability to capture the async values to template variables.</li>
</ul>
