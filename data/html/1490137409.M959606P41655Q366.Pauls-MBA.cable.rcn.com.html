<p>RE: Confirmed this is a problem with specific formulae and not Homebrew/brew?</p>
<p>RE: If it's a general Homebrew/brew problem please file this issue at:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/new">https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/new</a></p>
<p>Response: I think I will file this issue here and at the link provided above.</p>
<p>Why? Because the issue may be with a Ruby install, a Jekyll install via Ruby Gem, or a tool.</p>
<p>And, when I can't get my Jekyll server to run locally on my development machine, how am I to submit code to the GitHub server that has not been run locally and confirmed?</p>
